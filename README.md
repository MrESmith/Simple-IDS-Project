# Simple-IDS-Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for network traffic analysis.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Simple Network Intrusion Detection System:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `scripts` directory: `cd scripts`.
3. Run the IDS script using the command: `python simple_ids.py`.

## Features

- Captures network traffic and analyzes it for potential threats.
- Basic threat detection logic implemented.

## Usage

1. Copy sample network traffic files from the `data` directory into the `scripts` directory.
2. Run the IDS script: `python simple_ids.py`.
3. Review the output to see if any threats were detected.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced threat detection techniques.
- Add support for analyzing various types of network traffic.
